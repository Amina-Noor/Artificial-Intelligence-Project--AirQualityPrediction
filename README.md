# Artificial Intelligence Project – Air Quality Prediction

## Description
This project uses **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** to predict air quality based on environmental data.  
It estimates the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using parameters such as:

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)  
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)  
- Particulate Matter (PM2.5 / PM10)  

The goal is to **provide insights and early warnings** about air pollution to help reduce health risks.

## Features
- Predicts AQI using AI/ML algorithms  
- Visualizes air quality trends with graphs  
- Easy-to-use Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook  
- Can be extended for real-time monitoring
